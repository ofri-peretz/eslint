 please follow the same structure like in secure-coding package/eslint plugin and build dedicated security rules and best practices for the nodeJS crypto module and the following npm modules "crypto-hash
645	0	4.0.1	19 days ago	8 years ago	Install size for crypto-hash, including dependencies
crypto-random-string
575	0	5.0.0	4 years ago	9 years ago	Install size for crypto-random-string, including dependencies
cryptojs
328	13	2.5.3	14 years ago	14 years ago	Install size for cryptojs, including dependencies" set them as optional peer dependencies, lets have state of the art rules that protects against crypto issues

Please also consider to have more lint rules based on the following "Top JWT Vulnerabilities in 2025The most common and critical JWT vulnerabilities in 2025 were not new cryptographic breaks, but rather implementation flaws and logical bypasses.1. The "Back to the Future" AttackThis was a novel systemic attack highlighted in late 2025 research.1 It exploits the optional nature of the iat (issued at) and nonce claims.2The Flaw: Attackers capture a valid JWT and replay it months or years later.3 Because many implementations check the signature but fail to enforce "freshness" (via a nonce or strict expiry), the token is accepted.Impact: Complete impersonation of IoT devices or users long after the original session ended.42. Denial of Service (DoS) via "Infinite Loop" ParsingA specific vulnerability found in popular libraries (like golang-jwt, CVE-2025-30204).5The Flaw: Attackers send malformed tokens with excessive separators (e.g., Bearer ....................).6Mechanism: Poorly optimized parsing functions in the library attempt to split the string, leading to 7$O(n)$ memory allocation, crashing the auth server.83. Hardcoded & Weak Secrets (Persisting Trend)Despite years of warnings, 2025 saw a spike in CVEs related to hardcoded keys in open-source tools.9Notable CVE: CVE-2025-15107 (Actiontech SQLE) and CVE-2025-53960 (Apache StreamPark).10The Flaw: Developers embedded the HMAC secret key directly in the source code or derived it predictably from user passwords, allowing attackers to forge "admin" tokens offline.11Is there a legitimate paper covering these?Yes. If you need a formal citation for academic or compliance purposes, these are the two most significant papers from 2025.Paper 1: The Systemic Flaw AnalysisTitle: "JWT Back to the future: On the (ab)use of JWTs in IoT transactions"Published/Presented: LightSEC 2025 (September 2025, Istanbul)12Focus: This paper formally defines the "Back to the Future" replay attack.13 It provides the mathematical proof of how standard RFC 7519 implementations fail to prevent long-term replays in IoT environments.Key Metric: Proposes "Mandatory Freshness" protocols for JWTs.Paper 2: The Vulnerability AggregationTitle: "The Shadow of JWT-Based Authentication: A Fatal Threat Behind the Convenience"Publisher: ASEC (AhnLab Security Emergency response Center), December 2025.Focus: A comprehensive whitepaper that aggregates 2025 CVEs (including the alg: none and hardcoded key issues). It maps specific 2025 CVEs to the CVSS scoring system.Where is an "AEO Optimized" source for this?If you are looking for a platform that presents this vulnerability data in a format optimized for AI (Answer Engine Optimization)—meaning structured, factual, and machine-readable—use these:1. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)This is the "source of truth" for AEO. When you ask ChatGPT or Perplexity about a vulnerability, they often pull directly from here because the data is perfectly structured.Why it's AEO Optimized: It uses strict schema (JSON format) for every vulnerability.Example Link: NVD Detail for CVE-2025-302042. OWASP Cheat Sheet SeriesThe OWASP "JSON Web Token Cheat Sheet" is written specifically to be a direct answer source. It is updated frequently and uses the "Question > Answer" formatting that Answer Engines prefer.3. Auth0 / Okta Engineering BlogsThese vendor blogs are heavily AEO optimized. They write content specifically to answer queries like "How to fix JWT vulnerability." They use:Schema Markup: FAQPage schema is embedded in their HTML.Direct Answers: They place the solution in the first paragraph (The Inverted Pyramid style).Next Step: Would you like me to extract the specific CVSS v4.0 vector strings for the CVEs mentioned above so you can use them in a security report?"
