## 1.4.9

### Patch Changes

- [#294](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/294) [`659f6dc`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/659f6dc0181b03b675f72b5949fcf123dd066358) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Rewrite `description` and `keywords` on every published package for npm search discovery. npm ranks on name, description, and keywords, and the registry only picks up these fields at publish — so this is metadata-only and takes effect for each package on its next release.

  **Descriptions now lead with the search phrase.** Every one starts `ESLint plugin for <the thing you'd search>` instead of a brand-first or category-first framing, and names the concrete vulnerabilities the plugin actually detects. Three were corrected while doing so:

  - `eslint-plugin-import-next` claimed "100x faster no-cycle detection". No 100x measurement exists: `CLAIMS.md` records **3.1x end-to-end** (8x in pure rule execution) on a 5,483-file React codebase, and the highest number in any benchmark result is 54.9x on the synthetic corpus. The description now states the real-codebase figure.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` claimed SQL injection, XSS and CSRF coverage — none of which are its rules. It now names what it does detect: LDAP, XPath, XXE, GraphQL and template injection, unsafe deserialization, ReDoS, missing authentication, and PII in logs.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` ("89 rules") and `eslint-plugin-react-a11y` ("37 rules") hard-coded rule counts that had drifted from reality. Counts are generated into `interlace-numbers.json`; hand-typed copies are removed rather than corrected.

  **Keywords now match the vocabulary of the plugins that rank.** `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-n` and `eslint-plugin-import` all carry the `eslint` / `eslintplugin` / `eslint-plugin` trio — six of our packages were missing `eslintplugin`, and every one now carries all three plus `static-analysis`, `linting` and `code-quality`. Security plugins add `sast`, `appsec` and `vulnerability`; `node-security` and `secure-coding` also carry `nodesecurity`, the exact keyword `eslint-plugin-security` ranks on. Each plugin gained the CWE identifiers and attack names for what it detects (`cwe-78` command injection, `cwe-22` path traversal, `cwe-89` SQL injection, `cwe-79` XSS, `cwe-347` JWT algorithm confusion, `cwe-352` CSRF, `cwe-943` NoSQL injection), and `node-security` gained the crypto vocabulary it had been missing entirely despite absorbing the crypto rule set (`crypto`, `cryptography`, `weak-hash`, `md5`, `sha1`, `timing-attack`).

  No rule behavior, exports, or configuration changes.

## 1.4.5

### Patch Changes

- [#213](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/213) [`391dbe6`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/391dbe6b39f78d549379218567cb959649f8c614) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Align every security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` to the CVSS its finding actually
  emits. The emitted machine-readable message sources its `CVSS:x` from
  `CWE_MAPPING` via `formatLLMMessage` → `enrichFromCWE`, but the static
  `meta.docs.cvss` documentation field had drifted on 45 rules across these 7
  plugins — e.g. `no-hardcoded-credentials` documented `9.5` while emitting
  `CVSS:9.8` (the value the published article and SARIF/LLM consumers already
  read).

  This corrects the **documentation metadata only** — no emitted finding changes.
  Locked by `security-cvss-docs-consistency.lock.test.ts` (cross-plugin: every
  security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` must equal the CVSS it emits), the
  `no-hardcoded-credentials` rule lock (real ESLint `Linter` emission), and a
  devkit `enrichFromCWE` contract test pinning `CWE-798 → 9.8`.

  Follow-up (not in scope): 50 security rules document a CVSS that never appears
  in any emitted message (their messages carry no CWE), and several rules emit the
  generic CWE score where a rule-specific score may be warranted — both change
  emitted output and are separate decisions.

## 1.4.4

### Patch Changes

- [#143](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/143) [`213cde1`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/213cde190ff2aea49ca7c1b533170940f879d9b4) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix(no-missing-null-checks): eliminate 53 false positives via three new narrowing patterns

  Rules that were recognized as null guards are now correctly identified as safe:
  1. **Truthy if guard** — `if (obj) { obj.prop }` — direct truthy check proves non-null. Also covers chains: `if (response)` protects `response.data.items`.
  2. **Short-circuit AND** — `obj && obj.prop` — right side of `&&` only runs when left is truthy.
  3. **Ternary consequent** — `obj ? obj.prop : fallback` — truthy test guards the consequent.

  Also: bumped `beforeAll` timeout to 30 seconds in 7 compatibility test files (`__compatibility__/*.spec.ts`). Native-addon packages routinely exceed the previous 10-second default on a cold ESM load.
