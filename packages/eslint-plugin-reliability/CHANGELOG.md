## [3.1.3] - 2026-05-03

## 3.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#294](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/294) [`659f6dc`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/659f6dc0181b03b675f72b5949fcf123dd066358) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Rewrite `description` and `keywords` on every published package for npm search discovery. npm ranks on name, description, and keywords, and the registry only picks up these fields at publish — so this is metadata-only and takes effect for each package on its next release.

  **Descriptions now lead with the search phrase.** Every one starts `ESLint plugin for <the thing you'd search>` instead of a brand-first or category-first framing, and names the concrete vulnerabilities the plugin actually detects. Three were corrected while doing so:

  - `eslint-plugin-import-next` claimed "100x faster no-cycle detection". No 100x measurement exists: `CLAIMS.md` records **3.1x end-to-end** (8x in pure rule execution) on a 5,483-file React codebase, and the highest number in any benchmark result is 54.9x on the synthetic corpus. The description now states the real-codebase figure.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` claimed SQL injection, XSS and CSRF coverage — none of which are its rules. It now names what it does detect: LDAP, XPath, XXE, GraphQL and template injection, unsafe deserialization, ReDoS, missing authentication, and PII in logs.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` ("89 rules") and `eslint-plugin-react-a11y` ("37 rules") hard-coded rule counts that had drifted from reality. Counts are generated into `interlace-numbers.json`; hand-typed copies are removed rather than corrected.

  **Keywords now match the vocabulary of the plugins that rank.** `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-n` and `eslint-plugin-import` all carry the `eslint` / `eslintplugin` / `eslint-plugin` trio — six of our packages were missing `eslintplugin`, and every one now carries all three plus `static-analysis`, `linting` and `code-quality`. Security plugins add `sast`, `appsec` and `vulnerability`; `node-security` and `secure-coding` also carry `nodesecurity`, the exact keyword `eslint-plugin-security` ranks on. Each plugin gained the CWE identifiers and attack names for what it detects (`cwe-78` command injection, `cwe-22` path traversal, `cwe-89` SQL injection, `cwe-79` XSS, `cwe-347` JWT algorithm confusion, `cwe-352` CSRF, `cwe-943` NoSQL injection), and `node-security` gained the crypto vocabulary it had been missing entirely despite absorbing the crypto rule set (`crypto`, `cryptography`, `weak-hash`, `md5`, `sha1`, `timing-attack`).

  No rule behavior, exports, or configuration changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/252) [`d67e395`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/d67e3953c2748ad36e6aebe0f24b1d04e518b4d0) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Fix Codecov badge showing "unknown" — switch from flag to component URL format

## 3.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/141) [`38ab670`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/38ab670a0221684f4fd3d5dc3c05ddec7458ca2b) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix: remove false `meta.fixable: 'code'` declarations from 21 rules that had no `fix()` function

  Rules that declared `fixable: 'code'` in their ESLint meta without an actual `fix()` implementation would show the ⚡ auto-fix icon in editors and CI formatters but apply no change when `--fix` was run. This patch removes the misleading declaration from:
  - `browser-security/no-clickjacking`
  - `import-next/first`, `named`, `no-barrel-import`, `no-import-module-exports`, `no-namespace`
  - `node-security/no-buffer-overread`, `no-unsafe-dynamic-require`, `no-zip-slip`
  - `react-features/react-no-inline-functions`
  - `reliability/no-jsdoc-terminator-in-example` (uses `suggest`, not auto-fix; corrected to `hasSuggestions: true` only)
  - `secure-coding/no-directive-injection`, `no-electron-security-issues`, `no-graphql-injection`, `no-improper-sanitization`, `no-improper-type-validation`, `no-ldap-injection`, `no-unchecked-loop-condition`, `no-unlimited-resource-allocation`, `no-weak-password-recovery`, `no-xpath-injection`

- [#143](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/143) [`213cde1`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/213cde190ff2aea49ca7c1b533170940f879d9b4) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix(no-missing-null-checks): eliminate 53 false positives via three new narrowing patterns

  Rules that were recognized as null guards are now correctly identified as safe:
  1. **Truthy if guard** — `if (obj) { obj.prop }` — direct truthy check proves non-null. Also covers chains: `if (response)` protects `response.data.items`.
  2. **Short-circuit AND** — `obj && obj.prop` — right side of `&&` only runs when left is truthy.
  3. **Ternary consequent** — `obj ? obj.prop : fallback` — truthy test guards the consequent.

  Also: bumped `beforeAll` timeout to 30 seconds in 7 compatibility test files (`__compatibility__/*.spec.ts`). Native-addon packages routinely exceed the previous 10-second default on a cold ESM load.

- Updated dependencies [[`736a5fe`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/736a5fed47e673f6157ea900b29fe2a54e4bc7df)]:
  - @interlace/eslint-devkit@1.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- `no-missing-null-checks`: exempt provably-non-null identifiers (built-in singletons like `Math`, `JSON`, `console`, error classes; catch-clause params; constructor results; top-level imports) from the null-check requirement. Eliminates a large class of false positives without weakening real coverage.
- `no-unhandled-promise`: refined detection (see source diff).

| `no-unhandled-promise`     | Detect unhandled promise rejections           | CWE-392 |
| `no-silent-errors`         | Detect empty catch blocks that swallow errors | CWE-390 |
| `no-missing-error-context` | Require error context when re-throwing        | CWE-209 |
| `error-message`            | Require meaningful error messages             | CWE-209 |

#### Runtime Safety (4 rules)

| Rule                       | Description                                   | CWE         |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `no-missing-null-checks`   | Detect potential null/undefined dereferences  | CWE-476     |
| `no-unsafe-type-narrowing` | Detect unsafe type narrowing patterns         | CWE-704     |

### Presets

- `recommended` - Balanced reliability checks (4 rules as warnings)

### Known Limitations

Documented in `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`:

- `no-unhandled-promises`: Promises in callbacks or async iterators may be missed
- `no-silent-errors`: Intentional suppression vs. actual swallowing is hard to distinguish
- `no-missing-null-checks`: Business-logic guarantees not in types can trigger false positives
