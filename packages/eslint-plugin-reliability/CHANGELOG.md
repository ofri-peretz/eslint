## [3.1.3] - 2026-05-03

## 3.1.9

### Patch Changes

- [#364](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/364) [`86baa02`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/86baa026485bf93d63f1523d6eb382e0a40cbb3f) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Add the ecosystem and oxlint marks to the README logo row. Each plugin now
  leads with Interlace -> its ecosystem (node, nestjs, express, react, mongodb,
  postgresql, mysql, sqlite, prisma, drizzle, knex, typeorm, sequelize, lambda,
  vercel, jwt) -> oxlint -> ESLint; the generic quality plugins carry the row
  without an ecosystem mark. README-only change - no rule behaviour is affected.
  The patch bump is what carries the new README onto npm, which only refreshes a
  package README on publish.

## 3.1.8

### Patch Changes

- [#338](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/338) [`dc25c81`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/dc25c81ffda3c261c9f3d80a87931679cf8c059f) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Re-publish every package so npm carries the optimised artifact

  No source changed. This is a no-op patch whose entire purpose is to ship the
  artifact the current build already produces.

  **Manifests.** `scripts` and `devDependencies` are now stripped from every
  published `package.json`. Neither can do anything in a consumer’s
  node_modules — npm never runs one and never installs the other — but they
  shipped in all 27 manifests, cluttered the npm page, and were read by SCA
  tools scanning installed manifests. No package declares a lifecycle hook, so
  nothing observable changes. Every published package is bumped so this applies
  uniformly rather than to a subset.

  **Tarballs.** 20 packages were last published before the build pipeline
  changed and still ship `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, JSDoc in the emitted
  `.js`, and the full generated `.d.ts` tree:

  | package                            | published | rebuilt | saving  |
  | ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
  | `eslint-plugin-react-features`     | 547 kB    | 320 kB  | −227 kB |
  | `eslint-plugin-secure-coding`      | 653 kB    | 477 kB  | −176 kB |

  | `eslint-plugin-maintainability`    | 178 kB    | 116 kB  | −62 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-react-a11y`         | 232 kB    | 173 kB  | −59 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-reliability`        | 148 kB    | 90 kB   | −58 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-vercel-ai-security` | 187 kB    | 130 kB  | −57 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-operability`        | 90 kB     | 43 kB   | −47 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-jwt`                | 140 kB    | 95 kB   | −45 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-modularity`         | 98 kB     | 58 kB   | −40 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-nestjs-security`    | 122 kB    | 86 kB   | −36 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-sqlite-security`    | 54 kB     | 20 kB   | −34 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-sequelize-security` | 54 kB     | 21 kB   | −34 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-prisma-security`    | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-mysql-security`     | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-typeorm-security`   | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-drizzle-security`   | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-knex-security`      | 51 kB     | 19 kB   | −32 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-modernization`      | 45 kB     | 38 kB   | −7 kB   |

  Those 20 go from 3428 kB to 2169 kB — **−36.7%**. The remaining
  7 were released after the pipeline change and only gain the manifest strip.

  A new check in `scripts/check-published-artifacts.ts` fails the build if
  `scripts` or `devDependencies` ever reappear in a published manifest, so the
  strip cannot silently regress.

  The dependency ranges did **not** need updating: every plugin pins
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit` with a caret that 1.6.0 satisfies, verified by a
  clean install of an unchanged plugin resolving devkit 1.6.0 with zero
  dependencies and no `typescript` in the tree.

## 3.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#294](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/294) [`659f6dc`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/659f6dc0181b03b675f72b5949fcf123dd066358) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Rewrite `description` and `keywords` on every published package for npm search discovery. npm ranks on name, description, and keywords, and the registry only picks up these fields at publish — so this is metadata-only and takes effect for each package on its next release.

  **Descriptions now lead with the search phrase.** Every one starts `ESLint plugin for <the thing you'd search>` instead of a brand-first or category-first framing, and names the concrete vulnerabilities the plugin actually detects. Three were corrected while doing so:

  - `eslint-plugin-import-next` claimed "100x faster no-cycle detection". No 100x measurement exists: `CLAIMS.md` records **3.1x end-to-end** (8x in pure rule execution) on a 5,483-file React codebase, and the highest number in any benchmark result is 54.9x on the synthetic corpus. The description now states the real-codebase figure.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` claimed SQL injection, XSS and CSRF coverage — none of which are its rules. It now names what it does detect: LDAP, XPath, XXE, GraphQL and template injection, unsafe deserialization, ReDoS, missing authentication, and PII in logs.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` ("89 rules") and `eslint-plugin-react-a11y` ("37 rules") hard-coded rule counts that had drifted from reality. Counts are generated into `interlace-numbers.json`; hand-typed copies are removed rather than corrected.

  **Keywords now match the vocabulary of the plugins that rank.** `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-n` and `eslint-plugin-import` all carry the `eslint` / `eslintplugin` / `eslint-plugin` trio — six of our packages were missing `eslintplugin`, and every one now carries all three plus `static-analysis`, `linting` and `code-quality`. Security plugins add `sast`, `appsec` and `vulnerability`; `node-security` and `secure-coding` also carry `nodesecurity`, the exact keyword `eslint-plugin-security` ranks on. Each plugin gained the CWE identifiers and attack names for what it detects (`cwe-78` command injection, `cwe-22` path traversal, `cwe-89` SQL injection, `cwe-79` XSS, `cwe-347` JWT algorithm confusion, `cwe-352` CSRF, `cwe-943` NoSQL injection), and `node-security` gained the crypto vocabulary it had been missing entirely despite absorbing the crypto rule set (`crypto`, `cryptography`, `weak-hash`, `md5`, `sha1`, `timing-attack`).

  No rule behavior, exports, or configuration changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/252) [`d67e395`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/d67e3953c2748ad36e6aebe0f24b1d04e518b4d0) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Fix Codecov badge showing "unknown" — switch from flag to component URL format

## 3.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/141) [`38ab670`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/38ab670a0221684f4fd3d5dc3c05ddec7458ca2b) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix: remove false `meta.fixable: 'code'` declarations from 21 rules that had no `fix()` function

  Rules that declared `fixable: 'code'` in their ESLint meta without an actual `fix()` implementation would show the ⚡ auto-fix icon in editors and CI formatters but apply no change when `--fix` was run. This patch removes the misleading declaration from:
  - `browser-security/no-clickjacking`
  - `import-next/first`, `named`, `no-barrel-import`, `no-import-module-exports`, `no-namespace`
  - `node-security/no-buffer-overread`, `no-unsafe-dynamic-require`, `no-zip-slip`
  - `react-features/react-no-inline-functions`
  - `reliability/no-jsdoc-terminator-in-example` (uses `suggest`, not auto-fix; corrected to `hasSuggestions: true` only)
  - `secure-coding/no-directive-injection`, `no-electron-security-issues`, `no-graphql-injection`, `no-improper-sanitization`, `no-improper-type-validation`, `no-ldap-injection`, `no-unchecked-loop-condition`, `no-unlimited-resource-allocation`, `no-weak-password-recovery`, `no-xpath-injection`

- [#143](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/143) [`213cde1`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/213cde190ff2aea49ca7c1b533170940f879d9b4) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix(no-missing-null-checks): eliminate 53 false positives via three new narrowing patterns

  Rules that were recognized as null guards are now correctly identified as safe:
  1. **Truthy if guard** — `if (obj) { obj.prop }` — direct truthy check proves non-null. Also covers chains: `if (response)` protects `response.data.items`.
  2. **Short-circuit AND** — `obj && obj.prop` — right side of `&&` only runs when left is truthy.
  3. **Ternary consequent** — `obj ? obj.prop : fallback` — truthy test guards the consequent.

  Also: bumped `beforeAll` timeout to 30 seconds in 7 compatibility test files (`__compatibility__/*.spec.ts`). Native-addon packages routinely exceed the previous 10-second default on a cold ESM load.

- Updated dependencies [[`736a5fe`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/736a5fed47e673f6157ea900b29fe2a54e4bc7df)]:
  - @interlace/eslint-devkit@1.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- `no-missing-null-checks`: exempt provably-non-null identifiers (built-in singletons like `Math`, `JSON`, `console`, error classes; catch-clause params; constructor results; top-level imports) from the null-check requirement. Eliminates a large class of false positives without weakening real coverage.
- `no-unhandled-promise`: refined detection (see source diff).

### Presets

- `recommended` - Balanced reliability checks (4 rules as warnings)

### Known Limitations

Documented in `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`:

- `no-unhandled-promises`: Promises in callbacks or async iterators may be missed
- `no-silent-errors`: Intentional suppression vs. actual swallowing is hard to distinguish
- `no-missing-null-checks`: Business-logic guarantees not in types can trigger false positives
