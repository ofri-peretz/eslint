# eslint-plugin-react-features

All notable changes to `eslint-plugin-react-features` are documented here.

Entries below `## <version>` are generated from [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets);
the format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — no-arbitrary-token-class scans a tagged className again

  `@typescript-eslint` 8.68.0 changed `TemplateElement.value.cooked`: 8.54.0
  typed it `string` and emitted the RAW text for an escape it could not cook,
  8.68.0 types it `string | null` and emits `null`. Both directions were verified
  against a real 8.54.0 install, not read off a changelog.

  The rule selects `TemplateElement` under a `className` attribute, so a tagged
  template reaches it and a null `cooked` skipped the quasi — `rounded-[12px]`
  shipped unreported. It falls back to `raw`; the lock fails when the fallback is
  `''` instead.

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.19.1`

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — `items['map'](…)` is the same iteration as `items.map(…)`

  `jsx-key` — `items['map'](i => <li />)` and `Array['from'](items, fn)` reach the same properties the dotted spelling does, and the rule went
  silent on it. That is the notation bundlers emit, so the rule was off on built
  output.

  A dynamic `o[m]` has no statically known property name, so it is still ignored.

### Patch Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — deep-link, CORS, IAM and state-mutation gates read a subscripted member

  `Linking['openURL'](event['url'])`, `res['setHeader']('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')`,
  `registry['create'](payload)` and `this.state.items['push'](x)` each do exactly
  what their dotted spellings do. Seven gates across three plugins compared
  `property.name` before asking what the property was.

  Two more tests had pinned the miss — one describing the guard ("property is not
  an Identifier"), the other the notation ("computed callee property").

- **🐛 Fix** — `React['Component']` is the same base class as `React.Component`

  A class extending `React['Component']` IS a React class component, so a
  deprecated lifecycle method on it is the same finding — and
  `React['useEffect']` is the same hook, with the same dependency array.
  Three tests had pinned all three as valid; the hook's message also said
  "unknown" where it can now name the hook.

- **🐛 Fix** — `ReactDOM['render'](…)` is the same deprecated call

  A member spelled `o['k']` reaches exactly what `o.k` reaches, and these gates
  compared `property.name` before asking what the property was. They now resolve
  through the devkit's `propertyName`, which still abstains on the one shape that
  genuinely cannot be resolved: a key chosen at runtime, whose name is not
  statically known.

- **🐛 Fix** — `React['findDOMNode']` names the same deprecated API

  `no-deprecated` built its lookup key from `property.name`, so the subscripted
  spelling of a deprecated React member was invisible.

- **🐛 Fix** — `React['createElement']` builds the same element

  `no-danger-with-children` matched the callee on `property.name`, so the
  subscripted spelling hid the dangerouslySetInnerHTML-plus-children conflict.

- **🧹 Refactor** — hook and state-mutation reads carry `string | null` instead of casting it away

  `SET.has(propertyName(node) as string)` reaches the right answer for the wrong
  reason. `propertyName` returns `string | null` because `o[k]` names a property
  the AST cannot read, and that is not the same answer as "named, and not one of
  these" — the cast collapses both, and `Set.prototype.has(null)` being false is
  what made it look correct.

  5 sites across 4 files now ask the two questions separately, via
  `namesOneOf` / `memberPropertyName` from the devkit or an explicit `!== null`.

  No rule behaviour changes: this package's test count and coverage are unchanged.

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.19.0`

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — Add an install-size badge to the README prelude, linking to each package's packagephobia page. npm renders the README from the last publish, so a badge only appears on npmjs.com after a release.

  Install size rather than bundle size: bundlephobia measures a browser bundle,
  and nobody bundles an ESLint plugin into one, so the number would describe no
  real cost. It was also returning `429` for every package, `react` included.

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.18.2`

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- **✨ Feature** — **🐛 Fix** — a template literal is a string, in 82 rules that disagreed

  A rule that matched `require('child_process')` did not match
  ``require(`child_process`)``. A rule that matched `res.headers['x-api-key']`
  did not match ``res.headers[`x-api-key`]``. Nothing about the two spellings
  differs at runtime, and no consumer chose one on purpose — which is exactly
  why the miss was invisible: the rule looked correct in its own tests, because
  its tests were written in the same spelling as its implementation.

  Rules across these plugins now read a static string wherever the value is
  statically known: a plain literal, a template literal with no substitutions,
  and a concatenation of either. The same pass fixed computed member access, so
  `o['foo']` is read wherever `o.foo` was.

  **These rules now report on code they previously stayed quiet on.** That is
  the point — the missed spelling was a false negative, not an exemption — but
  a codebase written with backticks may see new findings on upgrade.

### Patch Changes

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.18.0`

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — `hooks-exhaustive-deps` decides stability by resolving the binding, not by its name

  Stability was matched against three name patterns — `/^set[A-Z]/`,
  `/dispatch/i`, `/Ref$/` — and that failed in both directions at once.

  It **reported real refs** whose names did not fit: `savedCallback`,
  `nextJwtToken`, `frame` and `timeout` were all `useRef` bindings required as
  dependencies across the pinned corpus, where React's own rule reports none of
  them.

  Worse, it **silently exempted reactive values** whose names happened to fit. A
  genuinely missing dependency named `setUpValue` or `dispatchTime` was dropped
  without a word — a stale closure that ships.

  Stability is now read from the binding: a `useRef(...)` call, or the second
  element of a `useState`/`useReducer` destructuring. Values from module scope or
  unresolved identifiers — imports, globals — are not reactive, which matches
  React and also fixes a pre-existing false positive on module-scope imports.

  Verified against `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` on nine cases; it now agrees on
  all of them.

### Patch Changes

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.17.4`

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — `no-unknown-property` stops reporting on custom elements and `xmlns`

  A census of all 65 findings on the pinned corpus found **65 false positives** in
  two classes.

  **Custom elements.** The rule skipped custom _components_ by their capital
  letter, but a web component is lowercase — `<altcha-widget>` — so it looked
  like a host element and every one of its attributes was reported. React passes
  attributes to custom elements through verbatim, and the HTML spec requires a
  hyphen in the name, which is the signal that was missing.

  **XML namespace attributes.** `xmlns` and `xmlnsXlink` on `<svg>` are valid
  React attributes and are emitted by every icon exporter.

  The message also read _"Unknown DOM property detected"_ without naming the
  property, which is unactionable even when the finding is right. It now reads
  `` `flooble` is not a DOM property of `<div>` ``.

  The rule keeps its job: `class` instead of `className`, and unknown attributes
  on ordinary tags, still report.

### Patch Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — `no-unknown-property` reported `loading`, `decoding`, and `fetchPriority` — three standard React DOM props for `<img>` (and `<iframe>`/`<link>`/`<script>` where applicable). `loading` and `decoding` have been valid React props for years; `fetchPriority` is the React 19 camelCase form. All three are in upstream eslint-plugin-react's known-property list; ours was missing them, so every lazy-loaded image in a consumer codebase produced three false positives.

  The lowercase HTML form `fetchpriority` still reports (positive-control test
  locks both directions).

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.17.3`

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- **🐛 Fix** — point `meta.docs.url` at documentation that exists ([#683](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/683))

  `meta.docs.url` is what ESLint hands to editors, CLI output and SARIF, so a wrong
  value is a dead "see docs" link in every consumer's IDE. It was wrong for 319 of
  478 rules, all pointing at `packages/eslint-plugin/` — a package that does not
  exist in this repo.

  `withCanonicalDocsUrls` already existed to fix this, but `docsUrlFor` hardcoded
  the `/docs/security/` path segment, so it could not express the nine quality
  plugins and rollout had stalled at three of twenty-six. The category is now
  derived per plugin, and every documented plugin stamps its rules on export.

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `@interlace/eslint-devkit@1.17.2`

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/565) [`4e26fd3`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/4e26fd3f7543fae34fb72dca029dafc9d254e831) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Two React rules now judge evidence rather than names.

  **`display-name`** reported every component. `hasDisplayNameInScope()` returned a
  hardcoded `false` under a comment reading "For now, always require explicit
  displayName", so `function Profile() {}` and `const Profile = () => {}` were both
  findings — in a codebase where every component is named, that is every component.
  React reads the display name off `Function.name` / `Class.name`, so those are
  already named and there was nothing to fix.

  It now reports the three shapes React genuinely cannot name: an anonymous
  `export default`, an anonymous class component, and `memo`/`forwardRef` with no
  binding to take a name from. Wrapper calls are walked through, so
  `const Row = memo(forwardRef(fn))` stays quiet. Measured at 4 of 67 files on the
  benchmark's safe corpus before the fix, all four this defect.

  If you were suppressing this rule because of the noise, it is worth re-enabling.

  **`alt-text`** now resolves `next/image` from its **import** rather than requiring
  `{ img: ['Image'] }` — a default nobody sets, on the framework most likely to need
  it. A renamed default import (`import Pic from 'next/image'`) is caught;
  `next/legacy/image` and `next/future/image` too. A same-named `<Image>` from an
  unrelated package is not, and neither is `getImageProps` aliased to `Image`, which
  returns props rather than rendering.

  This is new detection: expect findings on Next.js images that were previously
  invisible.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`20b22aa`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/20b22aab4cf3f49f9c3f72b8235550b55db92fb8)]:
  - @interlace/eslint-devkit@1.16.0

## 1.2.12

### Patch Changes

- [#499](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/499) [`47070de`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/47070de2ccb391252891c72633191709a9bdd03c) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Bound the TypeScript peer range and declare the React peer

  `maintainability`, `react-features` and `import-next` shipped
  `"typescript": ">=4.8.4"`, which claims support for every future major —
  including ones the repo has already pinned Dependabot away from. The range is
  now the majors actually tested: `^4.8.4 || ^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0`.

  `react-a11y` and `react-features` lint `JSXElement`, `JSXAttribute` and
  `JSXOpeningElement` and named no React peer, so nothing recorded which React
  majors their rules were written against. Both now declare
  `react: ^17 || ^18 || ^19`, optional, so no adopter is forced to install it.

## 1.2.11

### Patch Changes

- [#407](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/407) [`5ecf4d1`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/5ecf4d1baa56135ed2029a4477e9c45d8a921e25) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Correct the declared ESLint floor: `^8.0.0` → `^8.40.0`.

  `context.sourceCode` landed in ESLint 8.40. The shared devkit reads it without a
  fallback and 20 plugins read it directly, so on ESLint 8.0–8.39 the install
  resolved cleanly and then every rule threw
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ast')` at lint time — npm reported
  nothing, because the manifest claimed the version was supported.

  Measured on 8.0.0 / 8.39.0 (throw on load) versus 8.40.0 / 8.57.1 / 9.0.0 /
  9.39.2 / 10.8.0 (all produce the expected finding). No runtime behaviour
  changes; this only makes the manifest match what the code can actually run.

- [#423](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/423) [`4794017`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/4794017c3e21db2aa0b0f64af2d1703ebca97211) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Correct the ESLint peer range shown in the README Compatibility table.

  The manifest floor moved to 8.40.0, but every package README still advertised
  `^8.0.0 || ^9.0.0 || ^10.0.0`. The README is what npm renders on the package
  page, so the requirement consumers actually read disagreed with the one npm
  enforced: an install on 8.39.x warns about a peer conflict while the README
  says that version is supported.

  The range was missed by the original sweep because a markdown table escapes
  the union as `\|\|`, so a grep for the plain shape matched none of the 29
  files.

  Also updates `.agent/rules/readme-structure.md` and
  `.agent/compatibility-matrix.md`, which template this table for new packages,
  and adds a README-vs-manifest assertion to
  `scripts/__tests__/eslint-peer-floor.test.ts` so the two cannot drift again.

- [#309](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/309) [`237a6b0`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/237a6b03313e2ea935999ee84b2a6c8af33e50bc) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - `meta.hasSuggestions` now matches what each rule actually emits.

  ILB-Remediation measured 27 rules where the declaration and the implementation
  disagreed: 22 declared `hasSuggestions: true` without ever passing `suggest:`
  to `context.report()` (IDE quick-fix menus advertising remediation that never
  arrives), and 5 emitted `suggest:` without the declaration (latent — ESLint
  throws on that combination as soon as one of those suggestions carries a real
  fixer).

  `eslint-plugin-mongodb-security` gains four real suggestions where the rewrite
  is mechanical:

  - `require-lean-queries` — appends `.lean()`
  - `no-unbounded-find` — appends `.limit(100)`
  - `no-debug-mode-production` — rewrites the flag to `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`
  - `require-tls-connection` — adds (or flips) `tls: true` in the connection options

  Every other dead declaration was removed rather than faked. A workspace lock
  (`scripts/__tests__/suggestions-meta-lock.test.ts`) now fails CI on either
  direction of the drift.

## 1.2.10

### Patch Changes

- [#411](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/411) [`d0cc8b6`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/d0cc8b647a41c1a85950c87a60296ece0f3abc31) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Ship the JavaScript without tsc's layout.

  Every emitted `.js` is re-written through esbuild's `minifyWhitespace`, which
  removes indentation and line breaks. Across the ecosystem that is 3233 kB ->
  2023 kB of shipped JavaScript, a 37% cut; on disk a package install drops about
  28%. Indentation alone was ~32% of a compiled rule file.

  This is deliberately NOT minification. Identifiers keep their names, string
  contents are untouched, and the syntax tree is not rewritten — rule `meta`
  (messages, schema, docs URLs) stays byte-identical, which is what the docs site
  and `--print-config` read, and a stack trace from inside a rule still names
  the function it came from. Full mangling would have bought another 4 kB gzipped
  and cost both.

  Verified against the published artifact: identical lint findings including
  message IDs, identical rule names, and zero differences across every rule's
  meta, messages, schema and presets.

## 1.2.9

### Patch Changes

- [#381](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/381) [`74bbf60`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/74bbf60fe22feaed15df4330e73db1f72a8cee98) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Load rule modules on demand instead of at plugin load.

  Every plugin barrel used to `require` all of its rules the moment ESLint loaded
  the plugin, whether or not your config enabled them. `plugin.rules[id]` is only
  ever read for rules a config turns on, so the rest was parse-and-compile cost
  for code that never ran.

  The published entry now exposes each rule behind a getter, so a rule module is
  read the first time something asks for it. Measured on a 7-plugin config with 34
  rules enabled: 163 rule modules loaded and 251 ms of plugin load, against 34
  modules and 8.5 ms — total ESLint wall time 251 ms → 109 ms. On a preset that
  enables most of a plugin (`node-security/recommended`, 25 of 37) it is a wash,
  72 ms → 65 ms. It is never slower; the win scales with how many plugins you
  stack and how few of their rules you use.

  Nothing about the plugin API changes. `Object.keys(plugin.rules)` still lists
  every rule without loading any of them, repeated reads return the same object,
  and the `./oxlint` sub-export is the same plugin object it always was.

  `eslint-plugin-jwt` and `eslint-plugin-vercel-ai-security` also re-export their
  rule objects as named top-level exports, which cannot be deferred — those two
  keep loading eagerly.

- [#381](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/381) [`74bbf60`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/74bbf60fe22feaed15df4330e73db1f72a8cee98) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Declare what we support, load only what we use

  **`tslib` is gone from every package.** It was a NON-optional peer of
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit`, so all 26 plugins declared it as a dependency to
  satisfy that peer — 124 kB every consumer installed so twelve
  `require("tslib")` calls could resolve. The shipped JavaScript now inlines
  the TypeScript helpers instead (`--importHelpers false` on the emit pass that
  already re-writes it), costing ~9.5 kB in devkit. Zero `tslib` requires remain
  anywhere; verified by installing every plugin with no `tslib` in the tree and
  loading all 26 with every rule intact.

  **`eslint-plugin-import-next` had a phantom dependency.** Its rules
  `require("typescript")` at module load, but it was declared in neither
  `dependencies` nor `peerDependencies` — it worked only because something else
  in the tree happened to install it. A clean install crashed the whole plugin,
  not just the type-aware rules. `typescript` is now a required peer, which is
  what the code actually needs.

  **23 "technologies we support" declarations did nothing.** Seven plugins
  listed their target libraries in `peerDependenciesMeta` with no matching
  `peerDependencies` entry, and npm ignores meta for a package that is not
  declared a peer — verified by installing `eslint-plugin-express-security` and
  watching nothing install and nothing warn. `eslint-plugin-jwt` appeared to
  support six JWT libraries and formally supported none. All 23 are now real
  optional peers, matching the convention `pg`, `mongodb`, `prisma` and the
  other nine already followed:

  | plugin                                                          | technologies now actually declared                                                                    |

  | `eslint-plugin-vercel-ai-security`                              | ai                                                                                                    |
  | `eslint-plugin-maintainability`, `eslint-plugin-react-features` | typescript                                                                                            |

  All optional, so nothing is installed on the consumer’s behalf — the
  declaration is the supported-technology signal, which is exactly what it was
  meant to be.

  **A new gate compares declared dependencies against what the emitted
  JavaScript actually loads**, in both directions: a `require` with no
  declaration (works until someone installs cleanly) and a declaration nothing
  requires (weight every consumer pays). It understands that a dependency may
  exist to satisfy an optional peer of another dependency, which is why
  `eslint-plugin-import-next` legitimately declares `oxc-resolver` that devkit
  lazily loads.

The export now points at the build output, `dist/src/oxlint.js`.

  The path was hardcoded in `scripts/generate-oxlint-shims.ts`, so the generator rewrote any manual correction back to the broken value on the next drift check — fixed there rather than per package.

  This release also carries npm provenance: the affected packages were last published from a workstation, which has no OIDC token to attest with, so the published tarballs had no attestation. Publishing through the release workflow signs them.

- [#335](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/335) [`47cde07`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/47cde07f13fb128e973a46f2a66a68c3419cdef3) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Fix SDK peer declarations that npm silently ignored

  Twelve plugins listed their target SDKs under `peerDependenciesMeta` with
  `{"optional": true}` but never declared them in `peerDependencies`. npm drops
  any `peerDependenciesMeta` entry that has no matching `peerDependencies` key,
  so the metadata was inert — these packages effectively declared **no SDK peer
  at all**. Nothing warned: the failure mode of a dependency you never declared
  is silence.

  Each SDK now appears in both maps, matching the shape `eslint-plugin-pg` and
  `eslint-plugin-mongodb-security` already use — a supported major range in
  `peerDependencies`, `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta`:

  Ranges were taken from each SDK's real release history, bounded below by the
  oldest major whose call shape the rules still match and above by the current
  major. `cors`, `csurf`, `class-transformer` and `@aws-sdk/client-lambda` have
  only ever shipped one usable major. The `ai` range spans v4 because
  `require-max-steps` deliberately accepts both the v4 `maxSteps` option and the
  v5+ `stopWhen` form. The two `typescript` entries reuse the `>=4.8.4` bound
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit` already declares, since these are the same
  type-aware-graceful rules behind the same optional TS program.

  Every range admits the version this repo's `__compatibility__` specs are
  actually tested against, so the declaration cannot drift from what CI proves.

  The four SDKs still on `0.x` (`@openai/agents`, both Anthropic packages) use an
  explicit `>=0.1.0 <1.0.0` rather than a caret, because `^0.115.0` resolves to
  `>=0.115.0 <0.116.0` — a range narrow enough to warn on almost every real
  install. These rules match on call shape and never import the SDK, so the
  honest constraint is the pre-1.0 line, not a single minor.

  `peer-declaration-integrity.test.ts` now locks the invariant across every
  workspace package: a `peerDependenciesMeta` key with no `peerDependencies` twin
  fails the suite and is named in the diff. This class had already been fixed
  once, in a commit that never merged — nothing went red in its absence, so the
  bug came back on four newly published packages. A silent failure needs a lock,
  not review attention.

  **Nothing to migrate.** Every entry stays optional, so no install adds a
  package or emits a warning when the SDK is absent. What changes is that a
  consumer on an unsupported major now gets a peer warning instead of nothing —
  which was the point of the metadata in the first place.

  leads with Interlace -> its ecosystem (node, nestjs, express, react, mongodb,
  postgresql, mysql, sqlite, prisma, drizzle, knex, typeorm, sequelize, lambda,
  vercel, jwt) -> oxlint -> ESLint; the generic quality plugins carry the row
  without an ecosystem mark. README-only change - no rule behaviour is affected.
  The patch bump is what carries the new README onto npm, which only refreshes a
  package README on publish.

### Patch Changes

  Seven plugins listed their target SDKs under `peerDependenciesMeta` with
  `{"optional": true}` but never declared them in `peerDependencies`. npm drops
  any `peerDependenciesMeta` entry that has no matching `peerDependencies` key,
  so the metadata was inert — these packages effectively declared **no SDK peer
  at all**. Nothing warned: the failure mode of a dependency you never declared
  is silence.

  Each SDK now appears in both maps, matching the shape `eslint-plugin-pg` and
  `eslint-plugin-mongodb-security` already use — a supported major range in
  `peerDependencies`, `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta`:

  No source changed. This is a no-op patch whose entire purpose is to ship the
  artifact the current build already produces.

  **Manifests.** `scripts` and `devDependencies` are now stripped from every
  published `package.json`. Neither can do anything in a consumer’s
  node_modules — npm never runs one and never installs the other — but they
  shipped in all 27 manifests, cluttered the npm page, and were read by SCA
  tools scanning installed manifests. No package declares a lifecycle hook, so
  nothing observable changes. Every published package is bumped so this applies
  uniformly rather than to a subset.

  **Tarballs.** 20 packages were last published before the build pipeline
  changed and still ship `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, JSDoc in the emitted
  `.js`, and the full generated `.d.ts` tree:

  Those 20 go from 3428 kB to 2169 kB — **−36.7%**. The remaining
  7 were released after the pipeline change and only gain the manifest strip.

  A new check in `scripts/check-published-artifacts.ts` fails the build if
  `scripts` or `devDependencies` ever reappear in a published manifest, so the
  strip cannot silently regress.

  The dependency ranges did **not** need updating: every plugin pins
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit` with a caret that 1.6.0 satisfies, verified by a
  clean install of an unchanged plugin resolving devkit 1.6.0 with zero
  dependencies and no `typescript` in the tree.

  **Descriptions now lead with the search phrase.** Every one starts `ESLint plugin for <the thing you'd search>` instead of a brand-first or category-first framing, and names the concrete vulnerabilities the plugin actually detects. Three were corrected while doing so:

  - `eslint-plugin-import-next` claimed "100x faster no-cycle detection". No 100x measurement exists: `CLAIMS.md` records **3.1x end-to-end** (8x in pure rule execution) on a 5,483-file React codebase, and the highest number in any benchmark result is 54.9x on the synthetic corpus. The description now states the real-codebase figure.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` claimed SQL injection, XSS and CSRF coverage — none of which are its rules. It now names what it does detect: LDAP, XPath, XXE, GraphQL and template injection, unsafe deserialization, ReDoS, missing authentication, and PII in logs.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` ("89 rules") and `eslint-plugin-react-a11y` ("37 rules") hard-coded rule counts that had drifted from reality. Counts are generated into `interlace-numbers.json`; hand-typed copies are removed rather than corrected.

  **Keywords now match the vocabulary of the plugins that rank.** `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-n` and `eslint-plugin-import` all carry the `eslint` / `eslintplugin` / `eslint-plugin` trio — six of our packages were missing `eslintplugin`, and every one now carries all three plus `static-analysis`, `linting` and `code-quality`. Security plugins add `sast`, `appsec` and `vulnerability`; `node-security` and `secure-coding` also carry `nodesecurity`, the exact keyword `eslint-plugin-security` ranks on. Each plugin gained the CWE identifiers and attack names for what it detects (`cwe-78` command injection, `cwe-22` path traversal, `cwe-89` SQL injection, `cwe-79` XSS, `cwe-347` JWT algorithm confusion, `cwe-352` CSRF, `cwe-943` NoSQL injection), and `node-security` gained the crypto vocabulary it had been missing entirely despite absorbing the crypto rule set (`crypto`, `cryptography`, `weak-hash`, `md5`, `sha1`, `timing-attack`).

  No rule behavior, exports, or configuration changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/252) [`d67e395`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/d67e3953c2748ad36e6aebe0f24b1d04e518b4d0) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Fix Codecov badge showing "unknown" — switch from flag to component URL format

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/225) [`34ff5a8`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/34ff5a8e6f5126c5d1c0a524759e0af2b5476b46) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - CI-only: pin all coverage thresholds at 100% (integration target, merges last).

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/229) [`acc81a7`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/acc81a74d0c329027bf6011f5db4b1bf9beba650) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - `no-unknown-property` no longer fires on custom React components. The rule now
  only checks host (lowercase DOM) elements, matching upstream
  `react/no-unknown-property` — uppercase and member-expression JSX names
  (`<Box surface="card">`, `<Motion.div />`) accept arbitrary props.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#100](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/100) [`fcb6d8e`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/fcb6d8ed6c6f531fe11427508673a31fe754a2e6) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Expose the `component-api/*` rule namespace to consumers.

  Eight rules — `no-default-test-id`, `require-data-slot`, `no-is-prefix-prop`,
  `no-inline-style`, `no-raw-color-literal`, `no-arbitrary-token-class`,
  `no-kind-prop-discriminator`, `no-wrapper-sub-component` — already exist in
  `src/rules/component-api/`, but they were not previously included in the
  published `rules` map and so could not be registered by consumers.
  This release adds them so downstream apps (e.g. `apps/blog`, `apps/docs`,
  `interlace-landing`) can register the `componentApi` preset via:

  ```js
  import reactFeatures from "eslint-plugin-react-features";

  {
    plugins: { "react-features": reactFeatures },
    rules: {
      "react-features/component-api/no-default-test-id": "error",
      "react-features/component-api/require-data-slot": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-is-prefix-prop": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-inline-style": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-raw-color-literal": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-arbitrary-token-class": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-kind-prop-discriminator": "warn",
      "react-features/component-api/no-wrapper-sub-component": "warn",
    },
  }
  ```

  Each rule corresponds to a rule ID (R5/R6/R8/R11/R12/R18/R19) in the
  `interlace-component` skill at `agents/skills/interlace-component/SKILL.md`.
  The rules are not part of the `recommended` config — they ship as an opt-in
  `componentApi` preset that strict design systems can enable on top of the
  base react ruleset.

  Unblocks STR-1 in `agents/apps/blog/INTERLACE_AUDIT.md`.

### Patch Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/141) [`38ab670`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/38ab670a0221684f4fd3d5dc3c05ddec7458ca2b) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix: remove false `meta.fixable: 'code'` declarations from 21 rules that had no `fix()` function

  Rules that declared `fixable: 'code'` in their ESLint meta without an actual `fix()` implementation would show the ⚡ auto-fix icon in editors and CI formatters but apply no change when `--fix` was run. This patch removes the misleading declaration from:
  - `browser-security/no-clickjacking`
  - `import-next/first`, `named`, `no-barrel-import`, `no-import-module-exports`, `no-namespace`
  - `node-security/no-buffer-overread`, `no-unsafe-dynamic-require`, `no-zip-slip`
  - `react-features/react-no-inline-functions`
  - `reliability/no-jsdoc-terminator-in-example` (uses `suggest`, not auto-fix; corrected to `hasSuggestions: true` only)
  - `secure-coding/no-directive-injection`, `no-electron-security-issues`, `no-graphql-injection`, `no-improper-sanitization`, `no-improper-type-validation`, `no-ldap-injection`, `no-unchecked-loop-condition`, `no-unlimited-resource-allocation`, `no-weak-password-recovery`, `no-xpath-injection`

- [#186](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/186) [`edf208d`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/edf208d67ac2357312c97d8964fcf6a462e407eb) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Consolidation cleanup — no rule behavior change:
  - **react-features**: the README rules table now lists the 8 `componentApi`
    preset rules. The README generator (`sync-readme-rules.ts`) and the
    `plugin-rule-source-drift` validator now recurse into nested
    `docs/rules/<category>/` subfolders, so every documented rule is advertised
    consistently (previously the nested componentApi docs were silently dropped,
    which an earlier `readme` exception had papered over — that exception is now
    removed in favour of the real fix).
  - **node-security**: remove the orphaned `no-pii-in-logs` rule source — the rule
    was migrated to `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` and is no longer exported here;
    the dead source was still compiling into `dist`.
  - **import-next**: restore the `no-cycle` unit test after [#180](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/issues/180)'s SCC refactor
    (`computeSCCsFromFile` + `findShortestCyclePath` are now bridged in the mock).

  Also fixes `scripts/ilb-plugin-scope-audit.ts` to stop mis-reading config-preset
  keys (`'recommended-strict': {`) as rules.

- Updated dependencies [[`736a5fe`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/736a5fed47e673f6157ea900b29fe2a54e4bc7df)]:
