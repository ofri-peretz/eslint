### Patch Changes

- [#364](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/364) [`86baa02`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/86baa026485bf93d63f1523d6eb382e0a40cbb3f) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Add the ecosystem and oxlint marks to the README logo row. Each plugin now
  leads with Interlace -> its ecosystem (node, nestjs, express, react, mongodb,
  postgresql, mysql, sqlite, prisma, drizzle, knex, typeorm, sequelize, lambda,
  vercel, jwt) -> oxlint -> ESLint; the generic quality plugins carry the row
  without an ecosystem mark. README-only change - no rule behaviour is affected.
  The patch bump is what carries the new README onto npm, which only refreshes a
  package README on publish.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#353](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/353) [`e8e9ee6`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/e8e9ee6d521bac301d0554e54ec22afbe8f49e98) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Add `no-unscoped-mutation` (CWE-284) to the Prisma, Drizzle and Knex plugins

  Every ORM ships a bulk mutation whose _unscoped_ form rewrites or deletes the
  whole table. `prisma.user.deleteMany()`, `db.delete(users)`, `knex('users').del()`
  — each one type-checks, passes review, and only shows up once it has run against
  production data. `eslint-plugin-drizzle`'s entire published surface is this single
  check for a single ORM; this generalizes it.

  The detection lives in one place, `createUnscopedMutationRule` in
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit`, and each plugin instantiates it with its own sinks and
  remediation copy — the same shape `createSqlInjectionRule` already uses. Each
  plugin declares where its scope lives: an options-object filter for Prisma, a
  chained `.where*()` for Drizzle and Knex.

  Every instantiation is gated on the driver: the rule is silent in files that
  never import it, and silent on receivers that do not read as a driver handle.
  Without that gate, `delete` and `update` would match `map.delete(key)` and
  `store.update(patch)` — method names alone are not discriminators.

  | Plugin             | Sinks                      | Where scope comes from             |
  | :----------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
  | `prisma-security`  | `deleteMany`, `updateMany` | `{ where }` in the options object  |
  | `drizzle-security` | `delete`, `update`         | a chained `.where()`               |
  | `knex-security`    | `del`, `delete`, `update`  | any of the chained `where*` family |

  `argumentRole` is the one thing that cannot be inferred from the AST. A lone
  identifier argument is the _filter_ for Prisma (`deleteMany(opts)`) and the _table_
  for Drizzle (`db.delete(users)`); reading it wrong either suppresses the headline
  Drizzle finding or invents a false positive on every dynamically built filter.

  **Not shipped for Sequelize or TypeORM.** Sequelize gives its instance and static
  forms the same names and both accept an options object, so
  `user.destroy({ transaction: t })` (one row) and `User.destroy({})` (the whole
  table) are the same AST. Two false positives surfaced in its test suite, and the
  rule was withdrawn from that package rather than shipped with them — a rule that
  fires on correct code is the one users disable. The genuinely detectable case,
  `destroy({ truncate: true })`, becomes its own rule. TypeORM's bare-criteria shape
  (`repo.delete({ id })`, with no `where` key) is a third detection shape and is
  deferred for the same reason.

  Scope that cannot be read statically is treated as present, so the rule stays
  silent rather than guessing. Ships in `strict` only — promotion to `recommended`
  and `flagship` waits on a measured false-positive profile against the benchmark
  corpus.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#338](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/338) [`dc25c81`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/dc25c81ffda3c261c9f3d80a87931679cf8c059f) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Re-publish every package so npm carries the optimised artifact

  No source changed. This is a no-op patch whose entire purpose is to ship the
  artifact the current build already produces.

  **Manifests.** `scripts` and `devDependencies` are now stripped from every
  published `package.json`. Neither can do anything in a consumer’s
  node_modules — npm never runs one and never installs the other — but they
  shipped in all 27 manifests, cluttered the npm page, and were read by SCA
  tools scanning installed manifests. No package declares a lifecycle hook, so
  nothing observable changes. Every published package is bumped so this applies
  uniformly rather than to a subset.

  **Tarballs.** 20 packages were last published before the build pipeline
  changed and still ship `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, JSDoc in the emitted
  `.js`, and the full generated `.d.ts` tree:

  | package                            | published | rebuilt | saving  |
  | ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
  | `eslint-plugin-react-features`     | 547 kB    | 320 kB  | −227 kB |
  | `eslint-plugin-secure-coding`      | 653 kB    | 477 kB  | −176 kB |

  | `eslint-plugin-maintainability`    | 178 kB    | 116 kB  | −62 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-react-a11y`         | 232 kB    | 173 kB  | −59 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-reliability`        | 148 kB    | 90 kB   | −58 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-vercel-ai-security` | 187 kB    | 130 kB  | −57 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-operability`        | 90 kB     | 43 kB   | −47 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-jwt`                | 140 kB    | 95 kB   | −45 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-modularity`         | 98 kB     | 58 kB   | −40 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-nestjs-security`    | 122 kB    | 86 kB   | −36 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-sqlite-security`    | 54 kB     | 20 kB   | −34 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-sequelize-security` | 54 kB     | 21 kB   | −34 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-prisma-security`    | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-mysql-security`     | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-typeorm-security`   | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-drizzle-security`   | 52 kB     | 19 kB   | −33 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-knex-security`      | 51 kB     | 19 kB   | −32 kB  |
  | `eslint-plugin-modernization`      | 45 kB     | 38 kB   | −7 kB   |

  Those 20 go from 3428 kB to 2169 kB — **−36.7%**. The remaining
  7 were released after the pipeline change and only gain the manifest strip.

  A new check in `scripts/check-published-artifacts.ts` fails the build if
  `scripts` or `devDependencies` ever reappear in a published manifest, so the
  strip cannot silently regress.

  The dependency ranges did **not** need updating: every plugin pins
  `@interlace/eslint-devkit` with a caret that 1.6.0 satisfies, verified by a
  clean install of an unchanged plugin resolving devkit 1.6.0 with zero
  dependencies and no `typescript` in the tree.

- Updated dependencies [[`dc25c81`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/dc25c81ffda3c261c9f3d80a87931679cf8c059f)]:
  - @interlace/eslint-devkit@1.6.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

Six new driver-scoped SQL-injection plugins (CWE-89), each shipping one rule —
`no-unsafe-query` at `error` in `recommended`:

- **`eslint-plugin-mysql-security`** — mysql2 / mysql. Sinks: `.query()`, `.execute()` (gated on SQL keywords in the static text, since these are common method names outside MySQL). Remediation names MySQL's own safe API.
- **`eslint-plugin-prisma-security`** — @prisma/client. Sinks: `.$queryRawUnsafe()`, `.$executeRawUnsafe()`. Remediation names Prisma's own safe API.
- **`eslint-plugin-drizzle-security`** — drizzle-orm. Sinks: `.raw()`. Remediation names Drizzle's own safe API.
- **`eslint-plugin-knex-security`** — knex. Sinks: `.raw()`. Remediation names Knex's own safe API.
- **`eslint-plugin-sqlite-security`** — better-sqlite3 / sqlite3. Sinks: `.prepare()`, `.exec()`, `.run()`, `.all()`, `.get()` (gated on SQL keywords in the static text, since these are common method names outside SQLite). Remediation names SQLite's own safe API.
- **`eslint-plugin-typeorm-security`** — typeorm. Sinks: `.query()`. Remediation names TypeORM's own safe API.

All six instantiate the shared `createSqlInjectionRule` from
`@interlace/eslint-devkit`, so detection is one implementation and each
plugin differs only in sinks, precision gate and remediation copy. Install the
one matching your stack and you get exactly one finding per line.

None are added to `eslint-config-interlace`'s aggregated presets: sink names
overlap across drivers (`.query()`, `.raw()`), so bundling them would report the
same line more than once.
