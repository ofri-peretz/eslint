## 9.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **✨ Feature** — every rule runs natively on oxlint and Vite+, published as `oxlint-plugin-<name>` too

  - **`oxlint-plugin-<name>`**: each plugin now has an oxlint-native twin on npm,
    for installs from oxlint or Vite+ (`lint.jsPlugins: ['oxlint-plugin-<name>']`
    in `vite.config.ts`). It re-exports the same rules under the same
    `<name>/<rule>` IDs, at the same version, and does not install ESLint.
  - **`createOnce`**: 457 of 473 rule definitions are written in oxlint's
    `createOnce` shape, with per-file state reset in `before()`. ESLint runs the
    same rule object through a `create` the devkit derives from it, so ESLint
    behaviour is unchanged: every existing test passes, and oxlint parity on the
    benchmark corpus stays at 100% (3,932 shared findings, none on one engine
    only). The remaining 16 are listed, with reasons, in
    `.agent/create-rule-allowlist.json`.
  - **`meta.interop.runtimes`**: every rule now states where it is known to
    behave identically. `['eslint', 'oxlint']` means its own test suite passes
    on oxlint's RuleTester as well as ESLint's, and the tests enforce that on
    every run; type-aware rules stay `['eslint']`. The ESLint-only rules and the
    reason for each are listed in `docs/oxlint-runtimes.md`.
