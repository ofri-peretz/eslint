## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-08

## 2.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#213](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/213) [`391dbe6`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/391dbe6b39f78d549379218567cb959649f8c614) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Align every security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` to the CVSS its finding actually
  emits. The emitted machine-readable message sources its `CVSS:x` from
  `CWE_MAPPING` via `formatLLMMessage` → `enrichFromCWE`, but the static
  `meta.docs.cvss` documentation field had drifted on 45 rules across these 7
  plugins — e.g. `no-hardcoded-credentials` documented `9.5` while emitting
  `CVSS:9.8` (the value the published article and SARIF/LLM consumers already
  read).

  This corrects the **documentation metadata only** — no emitted finding changes.
  Locked by `security-cvss-docs-consistency.lock.test.ts` (cross-plugin: every
  security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` must equal the CVSS it emits), the
  `no-hardcoded-credentials` rule lock (real ESLint `Linter` emission), and a
  devkit `enrichFromCWE` contract test pinning `CWE-798 → 9.8`.

  Follow-up (not in scope): 50 security rules document a CVSS that never appears
  in any emitted message (their messages carry no CWE), and several rules emit the
  generic CWE score where a rule-specific score may be warranted — both change
  emitted output and are separate decisions.

### Patch Changes

- [#143](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/143) [`213cde1`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/213cde190ff2aea49ca7c1b533170940f879d9b4) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix(no-missing-null-checks): eliminate 53 false positives via three new narrowing patterns

  Rules that were recognized as null guards are now correctly identified as safe:
  1. **Truthy if guard** — `if (obj) { obj.prop }` — direct truthy check proves non-null. Also covers chains: `if (response)` protects `response.data.items`.
  2. **Short-circuit AND** — `obj && obj.prop` — right side of `&&` only runs when left is truthy.
  3. **Ternary consequent** — `obj ? obj.prop : fallback` — truthy test guards the consequent.

  Also: bumped `beforeAll` timeout to 30 seconds in 7 compatibility test files (`__compatibility__/*.spec.ts`). Native-addon packages routinely exceed the previous 10-second default on a cold ESM load.
