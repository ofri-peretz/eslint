### Rules

| Rule                  | Description                                              | 💼  | ⚠️  |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| `no-instanceof-array` | Prefer `Array.isArray()` over `instanceof Array`         | 💼  |     |
| `prefer-at`           | Prefer `Array.at()` for negative index access (ES2022+)  | 💼  | ⚠️  |
| `prefer-event-target` | Prefer `EventTarget` over `EventEmitter` in browser code | 💼  | ⚠️  |

### Presets

- `recommended` - Balanced modernization for most projects
- `strict` - All rules as errors for aggressive modernization

### Why These Rules?

#### `no-instanceof-array`

`instanceof Array` fails across different realms (iframes, workers). `Array.isArray()` is the correct, reliable check.

#### `prefer-at`

`Array.at()` provides cleaner negative index access and is part of ES2022. This rule helps migrate legacy `arr[arr.length - 1]` patterns.

#### `prefer-event-target`

`EventTarget` is the native browser API and doesn't require Node.js polyfills like `EventEmitter`. This rule helps migrate browser code to use native APIs.

### Migration Path

These rules are designed for incremental adoption:

1. Start with `recommended` preset (warnings)
2. Fix violations as warnings appear
3. Graduate to `strict` preset when ready
