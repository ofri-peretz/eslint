## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-08

## 1.2.9

### Patch Changes

- [#294](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/294) [`659f6dc`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/659f6dc0181b03b675f72b5949fcf123dd066358) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Rewrite `description` and `keywords` on every published package for npm search discovery. npm ranks on name, description, and keywords, and the registry only picks up these fields at publish — so this is metadata-only and takes effect for each package on its next release.

  **Descriptions now lead with the search phrase.** Every one starts `ESLint plugin for <the thing you'd search>` instead of a brand-first or category-first framing, and names the concrete vulnerabilities the plugin actually detects. Three were corrected while doing so:

  - `eslint-plugin-import-next` claimed "100x faster no-cycle detection". No 100x measurement exists: `CLAIMS.md` records **3.1x end-to-end** (8x in pure rule execution) on a 5,483-file React codebase, and the highest number in any benchmark result is 54.9x on the synthetic corpus. The description now states the real-codebase figure.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` claimed SQL injection, XSS and CSRF coverage — none of which are its rules. It now names what it does detect: LDAP, XPath, XXE, GraphQL and template injection, unsafe deserialization, ReDoS, missing authentication, and PII in logs.
  - `eslint-plugin-secure-coding` ("89 rules") and `eslint-plugin-react-a11y` ("37 rules") hard-coded rule counts that had drifted from reality. Counts are generated into `interlace-numbers.json`; hand-typed copies are removed rather than corrected.

  **Keywords now match the vocabulary of the plugins that rank.** `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-n` and `eslint-plugin-import` all carry the `eslint` / `eslintplugin` / `eslint-plugin` trio — six of our packages were missing `eslintplugin`, and every one now carries all three plus `static-analysis`, `linting` and `code-quality`. Security plugins add `sast`, `appsec` and `vulnerability`; `node-security` and `secure-coding` also carry `nodesecurity`, the exact keyword `eslint-plugin-security` ranks on. Each plugin gained the CWE identifiers and attack names for what it detects (`cwe-78` command injection, `cwe-22` path traversal, `cwe-89` SQL injection, `cwe-79` XSS, `cwe-347` JWT algorithm confusion, `cwe-352` CSRF, `cwe-943` NoSQL injection), and `node-security` gained the crypto vocabulary it had been missing entirely despite absorbing the crypto rule set (`crypto`, `cryptography`, `weak-hash`, `md5`, `sha1`, `timing-attack`).

  No rule behavior, exports, or configuration changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/225) [`34ff5a8`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/34ff5a8e6f5126c5d1c0a524759e0af2b5476b46) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - CI-only: pin all coverage thresholds at 100% (integration target, merges last).

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#213](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/213) [`391dbe6`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/391dbe6b39f78d549379218567cb959649f8c614) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - Align every security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` to the CVSS its finding actually
  emits. The emitted machine-readable message sources its `CVSS:x` from
  `CWE_MAPPING` via `formatLLMMessage` → `enrichFromCWE`, but the static
  `meta.docs.cvss` documentation field had drifted on 45 rules across these 7
  plugins — e.g. `no-hardcoded-credentials` documented `9.5` while emitting
  `CVSS:9.8` (the value the published article and SARIF/LLM consumers already
  read).

  This corrects the **documentation metadata only** — no emitted finding changes.
  Locked by `security-cvss-docs-consistency.lock.test.ts` (cross-plugin: every
  security rule's `meta.docs.cvss` must equal the CVSS it emits), the
  `no-hardcoded-credentials` rule lock (real ESLint `Linter` emission), and a
  devkit `enrichFromCWE` contract test pinning `CWE-798 → 9.8`.

  Follow-up (not in scope): 50 security rules document a CVSS that never appears
  in any emitted message (their messages carry no CWE), and several rules emit the
  generic CWE score where a rule-specific score may be warranted — both change
  emitted output and are separate decisions.

## 1.2.4

### Patch Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/pull/141) [`38ab670`](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/commit/38ab670a0221684f4fd3d5dc3c05ddec7458ca2b) Thanks [@ofri-peretz](https://github.com/ofri-peretz)! - fix: remove false `meta.fixable: 'code'` declarations from 21 rules that had no `fix()` function

  Rules that declared `fixable: 'code'` in their ESLint meta without an actual `fix()` implementation would show the ⚡ auto-fix icon in editors and CI formatters but apply no change when `--fix` was run. This patch removes the misleading declaration from:
  - `browser-security/no-clickjacking`
  - `import-next/first`, `named`, `no-barrel-import`, `no-import-module-exports`, `no-namespace`
  - `node-security/no-buffer-overread`, `no-unsafe-dynamic-require`, `no-zip-slip`
  - `react-features/react-no-inline-functions`
  - `reliability/no-jsdoc-terminator-in-example` (uses `suggest`, not auto-fix; corrected to `hasSuggestions: true` only)
  - `secure-coding/no-directive-injection`, `no-electron-security-issues`, `no-graphql-injection`, `no-improper-sanitization`, `no-improper-type-validation`, `no-ldap-injection`, `no-unchecked-loop-condition`, `no-unlimited-resource-allocation`, `no-weak-password-recovery`, `no-xpath-injection`
