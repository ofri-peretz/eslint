# How to Automate Your SOC2 Evidence Collection

_By Ofri Peretz_

---

I have been through enough SOC2 and ISO 27001 audits to know the feeling of dread. The auditor asks: _"Show me evidence that you prevent SQL Injection across all your 50 microservices."_

You scramble. You pull up pull requests from six months ago. You show a screenshot of a SonarQube dashboard that nobody looks at. You hope it's enough.

It usually isn't.

## Compliance as Code, Not Screenshots

The problem with most compliance workflows is that they are **detached** from the development lifecycle. Security happens in a silo, and compliance happens in a spreadsheet.

But what if your **linter** could generate your compliance evidence?

## Tagging the Truth

I built [eslint-plugin-secure-coding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-secure-coding) with a specific feature for Engineering Managers and CTOs: **Compliance Tagging**.

Every single error message generated by the plugin includes the specific compliance framework it validates.

```bash
src/auth.ts
  42:15  error  🔒 CWE-89 | SQL Injection detected | CRITICAL [SOC2-CC6.1, PCI-DSS-6.5.1]
```

## The "Autopilot" Workflow

By enforcing this plugin in your `eslint.config.js` and blocking builds on error, you create a powerful chain of custody:

1.  **Policy**: "We do not allow SQL Injection."
2.  **Control**: [eslint-plugin-secure-coding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-secure-coding) rule [no-sql-injection](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-secure-coding/docs/rules/no-sql-injection.md) is active.
3.  **Evidence**: Your CI/CD logs show the linter passing on every commit.

When the auditor comes next year, you don't show screenshots. You show them your **configuration file**.
_"We don't rely on humans to remember SOC2 Control 6.1. Our build pipeline rejects any code that violates it automatically."_

## Bonus: Let AI Fix It

The structured error messages aren't just for humans. They're designed for **AI coding assistants** like Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf. When an error includes the exact CWE, severity, and remediation context, these tools can auto-fix vulnerabilities with a single keystroke.

Compliance autopilot, _and_ remediation autopilot.

## The Punch Line: Measurable Assurance

Compliance shouldn't be a fire drill. It should be a boring, automated side-effect of writing code.

Using tools that speak the language of compliance (CWE, OWASP, PCI) allows you to bridge the gap between "Dev" and "GRC" (Governance, Risk, and Compliance). It turns your codebase into a verifiable asset.
