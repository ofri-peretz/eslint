# oxlint-plugin-sequelize-security

All notable changes to `oxlint-plugin-sequelize-security` are documented here.

Entries below `## <version>` are generated from [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets);
the format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- **🧹 Chore** — complete the npm metadata in every package manifest

  Every manifest declares `"sideEffects": false`; no module changes state outside itself when it is loaded, so a bundler may drop what it does not use. The `funding` field is removed: it pointed at the source repository, not at a funding page, so `npm fund` led nowhere useful. Each `oxlint-plugin-*` alias also declares an `exports` map (`.` and `./index.js`, each with `types` first, and `./package.json`); every path that resolved before still resolves. No code changes.

- **🔗 Dependencies** — updated workspace dependencies: `eslint-plugin-sequelize-security@2.0.1`

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- **💥 Breaking** — requires Node 22.13 or later; Node 18 and 20 are end-of-life

  `engines.node` is now `>=22.13.0` (was `>=18.0.0`). Node 22.13, 24 and 26 are the versions tested. Stay on the previous major if you cannot leave Node 18 or 20 yet.

  ## Migration

  Run your linter on Node 22.13 or later, or pin the previous major until you can:

  ```sh
  # Before: any Node 18+
  node --version   # v20.x
  # After: Node 22.13+ (24 and 26 are also tested)
  nvm install 22 && nvm use 22   # or 24, or 26
  ```

  Nothing in your ESLint or oxlint config changes.

### Minor Changes

- **✨ Feature** — every rule runs natively on oxlint and Vite+, published as `oxlint-plugin-<name>` too

  - **`oxlint-plugin-<name>`**: each plugin now has an oxlint-native twin on npm,
    for installs from oxlint or Vite+ (`lint.jsPlugins: ['oxlint-plugin-<name>']`
    in `vite.config.ts`). It re-exports the same rules under the same
    `<name>/<rule>` IDs, at the same version, and does not install ESLint.
  - **`createOnce`**: 457 of 473 rule definitions are written in oxlint's
    `createOnce` shape, with per-file state reset in `before()`. ESLint runs the
    same rule object through a `create` the devkit derives from it, so ESLint
    behaviour is unchanged: every existing test passes, and oxlint parity on the
    benchmark corpus stays at 100% (3,932 shared findings, none on one engine
    only). The remaining 16 are listed, with reasons, in
    `.agent/create-rule-allowlist.json`.
  - **`meta.interop.runtimes`**: every rule now states where it is known to
    behave identically. `['eslint', 'oxlint']` means its own test suite passes
    on oxlint's RuleTester as well as ESLint's, and the tests enforce that on
    every run; type-aware rules stay `['eslint']`. The ESLint-only rules and the
    reason for each are listed in `docs/oxlint-runtimes.md`.
