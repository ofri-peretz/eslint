## 🔧 How Commands Work

These commands are TypeScript files in `.cursor/commands/` that:

1. Read the corresponding checklist markdown file
2. Inject the complete checklist content into your prompt
3. Ensure the LLM has full context before starting work

## 📚 Checklist Locations

- ESLint Rule: `.cursor/commands/eslint-rule.md`
- New Package: `.cursor/commands/new-package.md`
- Workflow Maintenance: `.cursor/commands/workflow-maintenance.md`
- LLM Discoverability: `.cursor/commands/llm-discoverability.md`

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If a command doesn't work:

1. **Check file exists:** Verify the checklist file exists at the expected path
2. **Check Cursor version:** Ensure you're using a recent version of Cursor
3. **Manual fallback:** You can always manually reference the checklist files
4. **Check logs:** Look for errors in Cursor's command execution logs

## 💡 Tips

- **Combine commands:** You can use multiple commands in one prompt
- **Be specific:** After using a command, describe what you want to do
- **Review checklist:** The checklist will be included in the prompt, so review it if needed
