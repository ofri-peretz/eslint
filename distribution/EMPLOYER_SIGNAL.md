## 1. What This Repository Demonstrates

### Core Competencies Signaled

| Competency                 | Evidence                                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Systems Thinking**       | 15+ plugins across security, architecture, and quality domains        |
| **Product Engineering**    | AI-native messaging (AEO), strategic differentiation from competitors |
| **Scale Execution**        | Nx monorepo, CI/CD with Trusted Publishers, automated doc generation  |
| **Domain Expertise**       | OWASP mapping, CWE coverage, security static analysis                 |
| **Open Source Leadership** | Community-facing READMEs, contribution guides, semantic versioning    |

### The Interview Story

> _"I identified that the ESLint ecosystem was stuck in 2020—built for humans, not agents. I rebuilt the static analysis layer from the ground up with AI-native messaging, 100x faster dependency analysis, and OWASP-mapped security rules. The plugins now have X weekly downloads, proving the market needed this."_

This is a **Staff-level product engineering story**, not a "I made some npm packages" story.

## 5. Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk                       | Impact                                              | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solo maintainer**        | Enterprise hesitation                               | Document everything, consider co-maintainers                                                                                                                         |
| **No funding/company**     | "Will they abandon it?"                             | Position as strength: "Bootstrapped to 1M"                                                                                                                           |
| **Biome/oxc alternatives** | Some projects experimenting with Rust-based linters | ESLint has 41M+ weekly downloads & thousands of plugins — ecosystem is too entrenched to be displaced. Biome has <50 rules vs ESLint's thousands. Not a real threat. |
| **Cold start / no brand**  | Slow initial growth                                 | Viral content, influencer outreach, template PRs                                                                                                                     |

## 6. Unique Differentiators for Employer Conversations

### What No Other ESLint Author Has

1. **AGENTS.md Standard** — Novel protocol for AI agent context
2. **AI-Native Messaging (AEO)** — Messages designed for LLM consumption
3. **MCP Integration Strategy** — Ahead of the ecosystem curve
4. **OWASP-Mapped Security** — Enterprise compliance built-in
5. **100x Performance Claims** — Quantifiable, benchmarkable value

### The "Builder Who Ships" Narrative

You're not an AI researcher. You're a **builder who can take ambiguous problems and ship production-grade solutions.** This is exactly what companies like Scale AI, Vercel, and Stripe need for their platform, solutions, and tooling teams.
