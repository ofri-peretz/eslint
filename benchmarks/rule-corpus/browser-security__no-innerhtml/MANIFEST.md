# Rule corpus — `browser-security/no-innerhtml` (CWE-79)

Written from CWE-79 semantics and real DOM idiom, **not** from the rule's own
test file. The point is independent evidence: a corpus derived from the tests
can only re-derive what the author already thought of.

Each fixture is one file, one shape, with the rationale in a header comment.
`vulnerable/` must be reported; `safe/` must stay quiet. Every competitor is
scored on exactly the same files.
