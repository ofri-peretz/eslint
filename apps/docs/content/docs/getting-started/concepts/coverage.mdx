## Verification & Coverage

We believe in **radical transparency**. Every line of security logic in Interlace is verified through automated testing, and the results are publicly visible.

<Callout type="success" title="Trust Through Transparency">
  Coverage data is fetched dynamically from Codecov and cached for 4 hours.
  Updates are reflected automatically—no redeployment needed.
</Callout>

---

## How It Works

1. **Codecov Integration** — Coverage is measured on every CI run
2. **JSON Caching** — Data is cached using our json-cache policy (4-hour TTL)
3. **Real-Time Display** — This page shows live metrics from the ecosystem

## Coverage Standards

| Plugin Type           | Minimum Coverage | Rationale                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Core Security**     | 85%+             | Mission-critical vulnerability detection |
| **Framework Plugins** | 80%+             | Framework-specific security patterns     |
| **Quality Plugins**   | 75%+             | Code quality and best practices          |

## Why Coverage Matters for Security

High test coverage in security tooling means:

<Cards>
  <Card title="No False Negatives" icon={<Shield />}>
    Every vulnerability pattern is tested to ensure detection works correctly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No False Positives" icon={<CheckCircle />}>
    Edge cases are covered to prevent noisy, incorrect warnings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regression Safety" icon={<Gauge />}>
    Changes are validated against known vulnerability patterns.
  </Card>

## Coverage Standards Enforcement

### CI/CD Gates

Every pull request must pass coverage gates:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage

- name: Upload to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    fail_ci_if_error: true

- name: Check Coverage Thresholds
  run: |
    if [ $(cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total.lines.pct') -lt 80 ]; then
      echo "Coverage below threshold!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Codecov Configuration

```yaml title="codecov.yml"
coverage:
  status:
    project:
      default:
        target: 85%
        threshold: 2%
    patch:
      default:
        target: 90%
```

## What We Test

- **Detection accuracy** — Does the rule catch the vulnerability?
- **Edge cases** — Safe patterns that shouldn't trigger
- **Auto-fixes** — Do fixes produce valid, secure code?
- **Error messages** — Is metadata (CWE, CVSS) correct?

<Callout type="info" title="Our Commitment">
  Security plugins are required to maintain at least **85% coverage**.
  Framework-specific plugins target **80%**. We reject PRs that decrease
  coverage without justification.
