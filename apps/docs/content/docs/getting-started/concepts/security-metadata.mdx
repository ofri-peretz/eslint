## Industry Security Standards

Interlace maps every security rule to **three industry standards**, ensuring your vulnerabilities are classified using the same language as professional security auditors, compliance frameworks, and AI assistants.

---

## CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

<Callout type="info" title="What is CWE?">
  A community-developed dictionary of software weaknesses maintained by MITRE.
  Each weakness has a unique ID (e.g., CWE-89 for SQL Injection).
</Callout>

CWE provides a **common language** for describing security vulnerabilities. When Interlace reports `CWE-89`, any security tool, auditor, or AI assistant knows exactly what type of issue it is.

### Common CWEs in Interlace

| CWE ID  | Name                       | Risk Category | Example Rule                         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CWE-79  | Cross-site Scripting (XSS) | Web           | `browser-security/no-innerhtml`      |
| CWE-89  | SQL Injection              | Injection     | `secure-coding/no-sql-concatenation` |
| CWE-327 | Use of Broken Crypto       | Cryptography  | `node-security/no-weak-algorithms`   |
| CWE-798 | Hardcoded Credentials      | Secrets       | `secrets/no-hardcoded-credentials`   |
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS  | Web           | `browser-security/secure-cookie`     |

## OWASP Top 10

<Callout type="info" title="What is OWASP?">
  The Open Web Application Security Project publishes the most critical web
  application risks every few years. The Top 10 is the industry standard for web
  security priorities.
</Callout>

Interlace covers **100% of the OWASP Top 10 2021**:

| Rank | Category                  | Interlace Coverage              |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| A01  | Broken Access Control     | ✓ Role/permission rules         |
| A02  | Cryptographic Failures    | ✓ `eslint-plugin-crypto`        |
| A03  | Injection                 | ✓ SQL, NoSQL, Command injection |
| A04  | Insecure Design           | ✓ Architecture patterns         |
| A05  | Security Misconfiguration | ✓ Config validation rules       |
| A06  | Vulnerable Components     | ✓ Dependency checks             |
| A07  | Auth Failures             | ✓ JWT, session rules            |
| A08  | Data Integrity Failures   | ✓ Deserialization rules         |
| A09  | Logging Failures          | ✓ Logging best practices        |
| A10  | SSRF                      | ✓ URL validation rules          |

## CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

<Callout type="info" title="What is CVSS?">
  A severity rating from 0.0 to 10.0 that helps prioritize vulnerability fixes.
  Higher scores = more critical.
</Callout>

CVSS helps you **prioritize** which issues to fix first:

| Score Range | Severity    | Action                | Example                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 9.0 - 10.0  | 🔴 Critical | Fix immediately       | SQL Injection (9.8)     |
| 7.0 - 8.9   | 🟠 High     | Fix in current sprint | Hardcoded secrets (7.5) |
| 4.0 - 6.9   | 🟡 Medium   | Schedule fix          | Missing HTTPS (5.3)     |
| 0.1 - 3.9   | 🟢 Low      | Monitor & plan        | Info disclosure (2.1)   |

### CVSS in Interlace

Every security rule displays its CVSS score, helping you:

- **Triage** issues by severity
- **Report** to stakeholders with industry-standard metrics
- **Comply** with security frameworks that require risk scoring

<Callout type="warn" title="CVSS Disclaimer">
  Interlace CVSS scores are based on industry averages for each CWE category.
  Actual severity may vary based on your specific application context.
</Callout>

## Why This Mapping Matters

### For Developers

- Understand the **real-world impact** of each issue
- **Prioritize** fixes based on severity
- **Learn** security patterns from industry standards

### For Security Teams

- **Audit** codebases using industry-standard classifications
- **Report** findings with CWE/OWASP/CVSS mappings
- **Integrate** with SIEMs and security dashboards

### For AI Agents

- **Ground** responses in verified security context
- **Reference** specific remediation patterns
- **Avoid** hallucinations with structured metadata
