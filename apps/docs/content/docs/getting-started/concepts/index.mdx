## Why Understanding Matters

ESLint Interlace isn't just another linting tool—it's an **AI-native security ecosystem** designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with modern AI coding assistants.

Understanding these core concepts will help you:

- Get the most out of Interlace's security rules
- Integrate effectively with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude
- Contribute your own rules to the ecosystem
