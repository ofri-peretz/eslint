# Examples & Showcases

See how Interlace ESLint's error messages are optimized for AI assistants to understand and fix automatically.

## SQL Injection Detection

### Traditional ESLint Message

```
❌ Possible SQL injection detected (security/detect-sql-injection)
```

**AI assistant sees:** Vague warning, no context about what's wrong or how to fix it.

### Interlace ESLint Message

```
✅ CWE-89 OWASP:A03-Injection CVSS:9.8 | SQL injection via string concatenation | CRITICAL
   Fix: Use parameterized query: client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId])
```

**AI assistant sees:**

- **CWE-89** → Knows this is SQL Injection
- **CVSS:9.8** → Understands this is critical priority
- **Exact fix code** → Can apply the remediation automatically

## JWT Algorithm Confusion

### Traditional Error

```
❌ JWT should be verified (no-jwt-without-verify)
```

### Interlace ESLint Message

```
✅ CWE-327 OWASP:A02-Crypto CVSS:8.1 | JWT algorithm confusion vulnerability | HIGH
   Fix: Always specify algorithm explicitly: jwt.verify(token, secret, { algorithms: ['HS256'] })
```

**Why this matters:** AI assistants can now apply the exact fix pattern instead of guessing.

## XSS via innerHTML

### Traditional Error

```
❌ Detected potential XSS vulnerability (security/detect-non-literal-innerHTML)
```

### Interlace ESLint Message

```
✅ CWE-79 OWASP:A07-XSS CVSS:6.1 | Cross-site scripting via innerHTML | MEDIUM
   Fix: Use textContent instead, or sanitize with DOMPurify: DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)
```

---

## Prompt Injection (AI Security)

### No existing rule!

Traditional ESLint has **no rules** for AI security.

### Interlace ESLint Message

```
✅ CWE-77 OWASP:LLM01 CVSS:8.0 | Potential prompt injection via user input | HIGH
   Fix: Validate and sanitize user input before including in prompts. Use structured tool outputs.
```

---

## COPY FROM File Read (PostgreSQL)

### No existing rule!

Traditional ESLint has **no rules** for PostgreSQL-specific vulnerabilities.

### Interlace ESLint Message

```
✅ CWE-22 OWASP:A01-Access CVSS:7.5 | Arbitrary file read via COPY FROM | HIGH
   Fix: Never use user input in COPY FROM paths. Use COPY FROM PROGRAM with validated inputs only.
```

---

## Import Cycle Detection

### Traditional Error (takes 45+ seconds)

```
❌ Dependency cycle detected: ./moduleA -> ./moduleB -> ./moduleA (import/no-cycle)
```

### Interlace ESLint Message (takes 0.45 seconds)

```
✅ PERF OWASP:N/A | Import cycle detected - impacts bundle size and cold start | MEDIUM
   Fix: Extract shared logic to a new module, or use dynamic imports to break the cycle.
```

**Performance:** 100x faster detection with the same accuracy.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect             | Traditional  | Interlace           |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **Message format** | Single line  | Structured 2-line   |
| **CWE ID**         | ❌ Never     | ✅ Always           |
| **OWASP mapping**  | ❌ Rarely    | ✅ Always           |
| **CVSS score**     | ❌ Never     | ✅ Always           |
| **Fix suggestion** | ⚠️ Sometimes | ✅ Always with code |
| **AI fix rate**    | ~50%         | ~90%                |
