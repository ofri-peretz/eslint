<PluginHeader plugin="architecture" />

## Description

This plugin helps maintain clean code architecture by enforcing strict boundaries and detecting circular dependencies within your project. It aims to prevent spaghetti code and ensures that your module structure remains scalable and maintainable as your codebase grows. By visualizing and enforcing these architectural constraints, teams can collaborate more effectively on large-scale applications.
